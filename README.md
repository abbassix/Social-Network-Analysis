# Social Network Analysis and Network Science Project

## Overview
This project delves into the intricate world of Social Network Analysis (SNA) and Network Science, presenting a comprehensive exploration of network properties and behaviors. Through rigorous statistical and inferential analysis, the project unveils patterns and insights into the structural characteristics of complex networks. This is a project for SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS (INF/01) [https://www.unimi.it/en/education/degree-programme-courses/2021/social-network-analysis] course with Professor Gaito Sabrina Tiziana [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vUmucpoAAAAJ&hl=en].


## Key Findings
The project's findings are based on detailed statistical analysis and include measures such as network size, order, average and maximum degrees, density, transitivity, and average clustering coefficient. A significant discovery was the identification of scale-free properties within the analyzed networks, indicated by the inverse relationship between degree and node count.

### Highlights:
- Network size: Analysis of networks with varying sizes, highlighting the complexity and scope of network connections.
- Scale-free network: Evidence supporting the scale-free nature of the examined networks, emphasizing the presence of hub nodes with high connectivity.
- Network properties: Detailed examination of properties such as density, transitivity, and clustering coefficients, providing insights into the network's cohesion and structure.
- Inferential Analysis: Beyond mere statistical description, the project extends into inferential analysis to understand the underlying processes shaping these networks.

## Visualization
The project includes a range of visualizations, from network diagrams to distributions of network measures, aiding in the comprehension of complex network characteristics and the validation of scale-free properties.
